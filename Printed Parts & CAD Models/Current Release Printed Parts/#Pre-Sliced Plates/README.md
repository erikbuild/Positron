# Pre-Sliced Plates
Hey, these plates aren't updated as often as the other folders are.

While these are here for convenience, we ask that you read through the other folders and update your parts accordingly.

Thank you.

# Before Printing - CALIBRATION

**NOTE: The 3mf files in this folder default to 101% scale.  This may or may not be appropriate for your printer!  Select all the parts and change the scale to the scale percentage you determined above before slicing.**

ABS and similar materials are prone to shrinking, changing the dimensions of the printed part from the original design.  If you have too much shrinkage, holes may not line up for screws, and parts may interfere with others.

We strongly recommend first printing the Calibration Test piece `calibration_test_100x30mm.stl` (Printed Parts & CAD Models\Calibration\) at 100% scale in the recommended print settings.

Measure the printed part (ideally with at least inexpensive calipers).  The part should be as close to 100mm in length and 30mm in length as possible.  

Adjust the scale in the slicer until the printed part measures 100mm in length and 30mm in width.  **Use this updated scale for the rest of the printed parts.**

example: Printing the calibration piece at 100.5% yields a measured printed part of 100x30mm; use 100.5% to scale all other printed parts by X/Y/Z in the slicer.

NOTE: The 3mf files in the **\#Pre-Sliced Plates folder** default to 101% scale.  This may or may not be appropriate for your printer!  Select all the parts and change the scale to the scale percentage you determined above before slicing.
